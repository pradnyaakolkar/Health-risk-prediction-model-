# Health Risk Prediction (Heart Disease + Diabetes)

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict health risks such as heart disease and diabetes based on various medical features. The model uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of these diseases, leveraging datasets from Kaggle.

## Datasets
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Contains various health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
- **Diabetes Dataset**: Contains features like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.

### Features:
- Heart Disease Prediction
- Diabetes Prediction
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit for real-time predictions

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-risk-prediction.git
